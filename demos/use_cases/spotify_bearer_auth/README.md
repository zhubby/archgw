# Use Case Demo: Bearer Authorization with Spotify APIs

In this demo, we show how you can use Arch's bearer authorization capability to connect your agentic apps to third-party APIs.
More specifically, we demonstrate how you can connect to two Spotify APIs:

- [`/v1/browse/new-releases`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-new-releases)
- [`/v1/artists/{artist_id}/top-tracks`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-artists-top-tracks)

Where users can engage by asking questions like _"Show me the latest releases in the US"_, followed by queries like _"Show me top tracks from Taylor Swift"_.
