  Please convert this JSON into Markdown with the following layout for each album:

  - Display the album image (using Markdown image syntax) first.
  - On the next line immediately after the image, display the album title, artist name (use the first artist listed), and the release date, all separated by a hyphen or another clear delimiter.
  - On the next line, provide the Spotify link (using Markdown link syntax).

  For example, the output should look similar to this (using the data above):

  ![Album Image](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e025076e4160d018e378f488c33)
  **THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT**
  Taylor Swift - 2024-04-18
  [Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1Mo4aZ8pdj6L1jx8zSwJnt)

  Make sure your output is valid Markdown. And don't say "formatted in Markdown". Thanks!
